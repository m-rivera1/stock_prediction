    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Stock Predictions!</h2>
    <h4>Warren Buffet said it best when he said, <i>"If you aren’t thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”</i> Using Machine Learning, you will be able to use the Stock Prediction tool to help you decide which stocks to invest in. The Stock Prediction model operates by following a stock's previous patterns and predicting a new pattern for the next seven days. Then, you will be able to note the accuracy of each 'trained' prediction pattern.</h4>
    <h4>The code examples below show how our Stocks Prediction model was built.</h4>
